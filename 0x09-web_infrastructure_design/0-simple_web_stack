Explanation:
Server: A machine that hosts the web application and its components.
Domain Name: foobar.com is a human-readable address that points to the server's IP (8.8.8.8).
DNS Record: The www record in www.foobar.com is a CNAME or A record pointing to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Web Server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests from users, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Application Server: Processes the business logic of the application, executing the code base.
Database (MySQL): Stores and retrieves data as requested by the application server.
Issues:
SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If the server goes down, the website becomes unavailable.
Downtime during maintenance: Restarting the web server or deploying new code causes downtime.
Scalability: One server cannot handle a large number of incoming requests.
