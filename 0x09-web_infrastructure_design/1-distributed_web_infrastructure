Additional Elements:
Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to balance the load and provide redundancy.
Second Server: Adds redundancy and load distribution.
Load Balancer Algorithm: Round-robin, which distributes requests evenly across servers.
Active-Active Setup: Both servers are actively handling requests simultaneously. In contrast, an active-passive setup has one server active and the other as a backup.
Database Primary-Replica Cluster: The primary (master) database handles writes, and the replica (slave) handles reads to distribute the load.
Primary vs. Replica:
Primary (Master): Handles write operations.
Replica (Slave): Handles read operations and replicates data from the primary.
Issues:
SPOF: The load balancer is a single point of failure.
Security: No firewalls or HTTPS.
No Monitoring: Lack of visibility into system health.
