Additional Elements:
Firewalls: Protect servers from unauthorized access.
SSL Certificate: Encrypts traffic between the user's browser and the web server.
Monitoring Clients: Collect and send data about server health and performance to a monitoring service.
Firewalls: Control inbound and outbound traffic to secure the network.
HTTPS: Encrypts data to ensure secure communication.
Monitoring: Tracks system performance and health, and alerts on issues.
Monitoring Tool: Collects data on metrics like CPU usage, memory, disk usage, and QPS (queries per second).
Issues:
SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Can expose unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and web servers.
Single MySQL Server for Writes: Limits write scalability and introduces a potential bottleneck.
Identical Components: All servers being the same can make scaling and maintenance more challenging.
